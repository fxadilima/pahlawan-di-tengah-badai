# Pahlawan Di Tengah Badai

This project is an attempt to rewrite Jin Yong's story Yitian Tulong Ji (倚天屠龙记 or 倚天屠龍記), 
which has been translated into English by many dramas as 'The Heaven Sword and The Dragon Saber'.

The story itself is actually a part of a _trilogy_, and is the last part. Set in the late Yuan Dynasty,
just before the rise of Ming Dynasty, the story can be rewrite in many ways.

To simplify the documents, I write it in plain _markdown_ (there's no fancy styling or Frontmatters here), 
so that we can easily adjust it to fit our need later on. Note that the purpose of this project is 
writing the story, not publishing it as websites or any other apps.

We can always read it straight from Github.

These documents are written in Indonesian, with some Chinese texts added as explainations, so that we can learn
better about Jin Yong's original ideas, the meaning of names, places, and some Chinese idioms. 

[English version](https://wuxiasociety.com/the-heaven-sword-and-the-dragon-saber/) of the original story.

[Fan's translation of the same story](https://foxswuxia.wordpress.com/condor-trilogy-heaven-sword-dragon-saber/), 
maybe mixed between first and second revision.
