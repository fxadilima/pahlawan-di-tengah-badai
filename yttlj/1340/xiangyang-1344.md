![Ilustrasi Bab 11](/assets/images/Han-River-Xiangyang.png "Sungai Han")

Zhang Sanfeng dan Zhang Wuji menuruni pegunungan Shaobao. Menyadari bahwa kondisi Zhang Wuji sudah kritis, Zhang Sanfeng tidak lagi bicara tentang kemungkinan 
untuk sembuh. Ia hanya membantu Zhang Wuji melewati waktu sambil mengobrol. Mereka tiba di Sungai Han, lalu naik perahu untuk menyeberang ke seletan. 

Saat itu tahun 1344, menurut penanggalan Masehi, dan pemberontakan makin banyak terjadi di mana-mana. Ketika perahu mereka terapung di atas permukaan 
sungai, dan naik-turun mengikuti gelombang air, hati Zhang Sanfeng juga naik-turun seperti gelombang air itu.

Zhang Wuji tiba-tiba berkata, "Tai Shifu, jangan sedih. Waktu aku mati, aku akan bertemu dengan Mama dan Papa lagi."

Zhang Sanfeng berkata, "Jangan bicara begitu. Apa pun yang terjadi, Tai Shifu pasti akan menyelamatkanmu."

Zhang Wuji berkata lagi, "Sebetulnya aku sungguh berharap bisa mempelajari Jiu Yang Gong Shaolin, supaya aku bisa mengajarkannya kepada Yu Sanbo."

"Mengapa?" tanya Zhang Sanfeng.

"Aku berharap setelah Yu Sanbo mempelajari Jiu Yang Gong milik Shaolin dan Wudang, cederanya akan sembuh," kata Zhang Wuji.

Zhang Sanfeng mendesah dan berkata, "Cedera paman ketigamu itu adalah luka luar. Tidak ada tenaga dalam apa pun yang bisa menyembuhkannya." Ia kemudian 
berpikir, "Anak ini tahu bahwa dirinya akan segera mati, tapi dia tidk takut. Sebaliknya, dia malah memikirkan tentang nasib orang lain. Hatinya sungguh 
baik." 

Ketika bermaksud memujinya, tiba-tiba Zhang Sanfeng mendengar suara lantang dan kasar, "Cepat hentikan perahumu. Serahkan anakk itu, dan aku akan mengampunimu.
Jika tidak, jangan salahkan aku bertindak kasar." 

Suara itu datang dari jarak jauh, tetapi orang tetap bisa mendengarnya dengan sangat jelas. Orang itu pastilah punya tenanga dalam yang sangat kuat.

Zhang Sanfeng terkekeh, dan berpikir, "Siapa yang berani memintaku menyerahkan anak ini?" Ia mengangkat kepalanya, dan melihat dua perahu mendekat. 
Setelah mengammati lebih dekat, ia melihat seorang pemuda kasar, yang tidak bercukur, sedang mendayung perahu secara terburu-buru. Seorang anak laki-laki dan 
perempuan duduk bersamanya di atas perahu itu. Perahu yang mengejar di belakangnya lebih besar. Ada empat orang Lama dan tujuh-delapan orang prajurit 
Mongolia di dalamnya. Para prajurit itu membantu awak perahu mendayung, dan perahu itu bergerak lebih cepat. Tenaga pemuda kasar itu juga sangat mengagumkan, 
mendayung perahu kecil itu dengan kecepatan tinggi. Bagaimana pun juga, karena kekuatan para awak perahu yang mengejarnya, perahu mereka makin lama makin 
mendekat. Ketika jarak di antara kedua perahu itu cukup dekat, para Lama dan prajurit itu mulai mengambil busur dan anak panah, dan menembakkannya ke arah 
perahu yang lebih kecil itu.

Zhang Sanfeng berpikir, "Jadi mereka menyuruh pemuda kasar itu menyerahkan anak-anak yang dibawanya." Ia tidak menyukai cara orang-orang Mongolia membunuhi 
orang-orang Han, dan segera memutuskan untuk membantu pemuda kasar itu. Ia melihat tangan kiri pemuda itu masih terus mengayuh, sementara tangan kanannya 
mengangkat dayung lainnya untuk menangkis anak-anak panah yang diarahkan kepada mereka. Zang Sanfeng berpikir, "Semuda ini, kungfunya cukup dahsyat juga. 
Mana bisa aku lepas tangan melihat seorang pendekar seperti ini dalam bahaya?" Karena itu ia berkata kepada tukang perahunya, "Ayo kita bantu mereka."

Tukang perahu itu ketakutan setelah melihat pemandangan itu. Ia mencoba sebisanya untuk menjauh dari keributan yangs edang terjadi. Karena itu ketika mendengar 
kata-kata Zhang Sanfeng, ia berkata dengan terkejut, "Dao... Daozhang, kau bercanda ya?" 

Menyadari bahwa mereka tidak bisa membuang waktu lagi, Zhang Sanfeng merebut dayung dari si tukang perahu, lalu mulai mengayuh ke arah kedua perahu itu. 
Tiba-tiba ia mendengar pekikan keras, ketika sebatang anak panah mengenai punggung anak laki-laki di dalam perahu yang lebih kecil. Pemuda kasar itu segera 
kehilangan ketenangannya, dan buru-buru memeriksa luka anak itu. Pada saat itu, dua anak panah mengenai bahu dan punggungnya. Dengan cedera itu, pemuda kasar 
itu tidak mampu lagi memegang dayungnya, dan dayung itu pun jatuh ke dalam air. Perahu itu segera berhenti. Perahu yang lebih besar berhasil mengejar, 
lalu para prajurit dan Lama melompat ke dalam perahu kecil. Tetapi pemuda kasar itu ternyata tidak menyerah, dan melawan mereka dengan segenap tenaganya.

Zhang Sanfeng berteriak, "Hentikan! Aku tidak bisa membiarkan kalian menyakiti siapa pun!"

Ketika perahunya mendekat, Zhang Sanfeng melompat ke arah perahu pemuda kasar itu. Dua orang prajurit menembakkan anak panah ke arahnya. Tetapi hanya dengan 
mengebaskan jubahnya, Zhang Sanfeng dengan mudah menyingkirkan anak-anak panah itu. Begitu mendarat, telapak tangan kirinya meluncur, dan kedua perwira itu pun 
jatuh ke dalam air. Ketika melihatnya, para perwira lain dan Lama-Lama itu terpaku saking terkejut. Komandan prajurit berkata, "Daozhang, kau mau apa?"

Zhang SanFeng yelled, “Filthy Mongols! Trying to do more evil, hurting more civilians?
Get out of here!” That officer said, “Do you know who he is? He is a remaining member
of Yuan Province Devil Cult rebels, a wanted outlaw!”
Zhang SanFeng gasped upon hearing the words ‘Yuan Province Devil Cult rebel’. He
thought, “So this man is Zhou ZiWang’s subordinate?” He turned and asked the burly
man, “Is he speaking the truth?”
That burly man’s whole body filled with blood, as his left hand clutched the little boy,
and cried, “They... they killed little master.” This sentence confirmed his identity.
Zhang SanFeng said in shock, “Is this Zhou ZiWang’s son?”
That burly man said, “That’s correct. I could not carry out my order, so what’s the need
to keep on living?” He slowly put down the boy’s body, and then attacked an officer. But
he’s already injured, plus the arrows are poisonous. So even before he could fully get
up, he fell down onto the deck.

At this time, the little girl rushed towards a man’s body in the cabin, crying, “Papa!
Papa!” Looking at the clothing on the body, Zhang SanFeng figured this man must be
the boatman.
He thought, “If I had known the Devil Cult was involved, I wouldn’t have gotten inter-
fered. But I can’t back out now.” So he said to the officer, “The boy’s already dead. The
other man’s already seriously injured, and will die soon. Since you’ve already accom-
plished your task, you can surely leave!” That officer said, “No, I have to get their
heads.” Zhang SanFeng said, “Why be so excessive?” That officer said, “Who are you,
old priest? What gives you the right to intervene in this matter?” Zhang SanFeng chuck-
led, and said, “Who cares who I am? Everyone has the right to intervene in all matters.”
That officer gave his subordinates a gesture, and said, “What is your Taoist title? Which
temple do you reside in?” Before Zhang SanFeng could respond, two other officers
quickly raised their sabers, and attacked him. These two officers were already quite
close to Zhang SanFeng. Plus, due to the small space of the boat, Zhang SanFeng had
nowhere to evade.
But he quickly turned to the side, and with a quick twist of the body, dodged the sabers.
His two palms quickly shot out, reaching the backs of the two officers, and yelled, “Get
back there!” As the palms connect, the two officers flew out, landing in the middle of
the large boat they came from. Zhang SanFeng hasn’t fought anyone in ages. But felt a
bit unsatisfied simply beating up on these mediocre fighters.

That officer in charge gasped, and stuttered, “You... you... could you be...?” Zhang
SanFeng swept his robe, and yelled, “This old priest only kills Mongols!” The lamas and
officers immediately felt a strong wind bearing down hard on them, preventing them
from breathing. After the wind passed, their faces all turned white. All of them then
quickly returned to the large boat.
Zhang SanFeng took out a pill and put it in the burly man’s mouth. Then he rowed the
boat to his own. Just as he’s about to help the burly man switch boats, he saw the burly
man carry the boy’s body in one hand, the little girl in the other, and stepped to the ad-
jacent boat. Zhang SanFeng thought, “Despite heavy injuries, this man still cares for his
little master. His loyalty is very admirable. Although I didn’t mean to save him, this
man is certainly worth saving.” He then helped take out the arrows out of the burly
man, and applied medicine to the wounds.
That little girl watched her father’s body float away with his boat, and cried incessantly.
The burly man said, “Those damn Mongols are really vicious. The first thing they did
was to kill the boatman. If you hadn’t gotten here in time, this girl would have likely
died too.”
Zhang SanFeng thought, “Right now, with WuJi having trouble moving, and this man
being a wanted man. If we use the old river dock and seek lodgings there, I’d have trou-
ble taking care of both people.” He took out three taels of silver and gave them to the
boatman, said, “Sir, can you row east to the Tai Ping area? We’ll seek lodgings there.”
That boatman was already in awe of Zhang SanFeng after watching him defeat those
Mongols. So when Zhang SanFeng gave him so much money, he quickly complied, and
began to row east.
That burly man got on his knees and kowtowed to Zhang SanFeng, said, “Thank you so
much for saving my life. Chang YuChun[1] pays you his respect.” Zhang SanFeng
quickly helped him up, and said, “Hero Chang, you don’t need to be so courteous.”
Upon touching Chang YuChun’s hand, Zhang SanFeng found it to be icy cold. He asked
in shock, “Is Hero Chang injured internally?” Chang YuChun said, “As I escorted little
master down south, I fought against the Mongols four times. A lama managed to land
two palm strikes on me, once on the chest and once on the back.
Zhang SanFeng checked his pulse, only to find it quite weak. He then opened Chang
YuChun’s clothing, saw a heavy mark left by a palm strike, meaning the injury is quite
serious. Any other man would’ve not have been able to hold up for such a long time.
But this man managed to travel all the way here, battling along the way. Only a true
hero can do something like this. Zhang SanFeng quickly ordered Chang YuChun to stop
speaking, and to rest in the cabin.

That little girl is around ten. Her feet are bare, and her clothing’s tattered. Despite being
a boatman’s daughter, she was an incredible young beauty, as she sat there in tears.
Zhang SanFeng asked her, “Little girl, what’s your name?” That girl said, “My surname
is Zhou. My name is Zhou ZhiRuo.” Zhang SanFeng thought, “For a boatman’s daughter,
she does certainly have an elegant name.” He asked, “Where is your home? Is there
anyone else in your family? I’ll have this boatman take you back home.” Zhou ZhiRuo
said in tears, “I live with my dad on the boat. I... I have no other relatives.” Zhang
SanFeng sighed, and thought, “Looks like she’s an orphan. What should I do about her?”
Chang YuChun said, “Old priest’s kung fu is incredible. May I ask for your title?” Zhang
SanFeng said, “I’m called Zhang SanFeng.” Chang YuChun gasped loudly, sat up, and
yelled, “So you are Wu Dang’s venerable Priest Zhang. No wonder your martial arts is
so incredible. I’m really lucky to have to have met such a divine priest today.”

Zhang SanFeng said with a smile, “You’re too flattering. I simply happened to have lived
a few extra years. Certainly not worthy of being ‘divine’. Hero Chang, please lie back
down.” Seeing Chang YuChun’s straightforward and sincere demeanor, Zhang SanFeng
found himself liking this man quite a lot. But due to Chang YuChun’s Devil Cult roots,
Zhang SanFeng did not wish to talk too much with him, and said, “Your injury’s very se-
rious. Don’t talk if you don’t have to.”
Because of his experience, Zhang SanFeng tends to be quite unbiased towards both the
righteous and the devilish sects. He even once told Zhang CuiShan “You must never
look down on others just because you reside in the position of the so-called righteous
sect. The two words of ‘good’ and ‘evil’ were originally hard to differentiate. A member
of the orthodox sect when harboring thoughts of impurity and immorality will be con-
sidered as a wicked villain, and similarly if a member from the evil sect harbors a heart
that is completely directed towards goodness, then that person is a gentleman.” But af-
ter Zhang CuiShan’s suicide, Zhang SanFeng has grieved much for the loss of his disci-
ple, and felt great enmity towards the Heavenly Eagle Sect. Remembering his third
disciple’s crippled condition, his fifth disciple’s death, both due to the Heavenly Eagle
Sect, Zhang SanFeng couldn’t help but feel extra painful in regards to the word ‘devil’.
That Zhou ZiWang is Elder Mi Le’s disciple of Devil Cult, or “Ming Cult”[2]. Many years
ago, he started a revolution in the Jiang Xi province, proclaiming himself Emperor, call-
ing his dynasty ‘Zhou’. It was soon destroyed by the Yuan troops, and Zhou ZiWang was
executed. Although Elder Mi Le and the Heavenly Eagle Sect are different groups of
people, they both originated from the Ming Cult. When Zhou ZiWang rebelled, Yin
TianZheng also stirred up much trouble in the Zhe Jiang province. Zhang SanFeng res-
cued Chang YuChun today was only a spur of the moment decision, before asking about
Chang YuChun’s identity.

It was already dark when they arrived at the town. Zhang SanFeng bought four dishes
from a restaurant, chicken, pork, fish, and vegetables, and they ate on the boat. Zhang
SanFeng told Zhou ZhiRuo and Chang YuChun to go ahead and eat, while he would feed
Zhang WuJi. Chang YuChun asked him why. Zhang SanFeng responded by saying that
he had sealed Zhang WuJi’s pressure points around the vital organs, to prevent the poi-
son from getting in. In his depressed state, Zhang WuJi didn’t want to eat. And when
Zhang SanFeng tried to feed him, he would simply shake his head.
Zhou ZhiRuo took the bowl from Zhang SanFeng’s hand, and said, “How about let me
take care of this little friend, while you go ahead and eat?” Zhang WuJi said, “I don’t
need to eat. I’m already full.” Zhou ZhiRuo said, “Little friend, if you don’t eat, the old
priest would be too unhappy to eat. If he won’t eat, then wouldn’t he be hungry?”

Zhang WuJi realized that she’s right, and ate the food Zhou ZhiRuo put by his mouth.
Zhou ZhiRuo carefully removed all the bones from the fish and chicken, and sweetened
the meat with the sauces. So they tasted very good. Zhang WuJi quickly finished a
whole bowl of food.
Zhang SanFeng thought, “Considering his crippling illness, and that both his parents
are dead, WuJi really should have a attentive girl to serve him.”
Chang YuChun did not touch the meat dishes. Instead, he quickly finished the vegetable
dish. Even with the injury, he ate four big bowls of rice. Zhang SanFeng urged him to
eat some meat. Chang YuChun responded, “Venerable Zhang, I’m a devout Buddhist. I
don’t eat meat.” Zhang SanFeng said, “Oh, that’s right. I forgot.” He immediately re-
membered, the Devil Cult has very strict rules, forbidding its members to eat meat. This
has been true since the Tang Dynasty. Near the end of the Northern Sung Dynasty, the
leader of the Ming Cult rebelled in the Zhe Dong province. At the time, the people called
them ‘Vegetarian Devil Honoring Cult’.
Because the two big rules of the Ming Cult are to never eat meat, and to always honor
the Devil. Under attacks from the government and the martial world, the disciples of
the Ming Cult began to hide their identities. So they always say they are devout
Buddhists to cover their vegetarian ways.

Chang YuChun said, “Venerable Zhang, you saved my life, and already knows my back-
ground. So there’s no need for me to hide it. I am indeed a member of the Ming Cult.
The government thinks of us as rebels. The righteous sects look down upon us, thinking
we’re just a bunch of bandits, or that we’re minions of the devil. But for you to save me,
even knowing who I am, I really don’t know how to repay for your kindness.”
Zhang SanFeng knows about the origins of the Devil Cult. The God they worship is
called ‘Muo Ni’. But the worshipers call him ‘Honorable Brightness’. When the cult
spread into the central plains in the Tang Dynasty, it was called ‘Muo Ni Cult’, and also
‘Cult of the Illuminating Light’. Its worshippers called it the ‘Ming Cult’, but others call it
the Devil Cult. Zhang SanFeng sighed, and said, “Hero Chang...”
Chang YuChun quickly cut in, “Venerable priest, you really don’t need to call me a
‘hero’. Just call me YuChun.” Zhang SanFeng said, “Alright. YuChun, how old are you?”
Chang YuChun said, “Twenty.”
Zhang SanFeng said, “You’re just becoming an adult. So although you’ve entered the
Devil Cult, you haven’t sunk in too deeply. You can still get out before it’s too late. I have
a few words that you may not like. Do you want to hear them?” Chang YuChun said, “Of
course. I’d love to hear any advice from Venerable Zhang.”
Zhang SanFeng said, “Good! I want you to leave the Devil Cult. If you like Wu Dang, I’ll
have my eldest student Song YuanQiao take you in as his disciple. This way, you can
later walk the martial world with your head up, as no one will ever look down upon
you again.”
As the head of the Seven Heroes of Wu Dang, everyone knows the famous Song
YuanQiao. Normally it’s almost impossible for people to even see him. The seven Wu
Dang heroes recently began to take in students. But they have very strict standards.
Only the most upright youngsters with great potential are admitted. As a member of
the Devil Cult, a cult most people frown upon, this really is a once in a lifetime opportu-
nity for Chang YuChun.
Yet his response was, “I deeply thank you for your offer. But since I am already a mem-
ber of the Ming Cult, I cannot ever leave.” Zhang SanFeng tried to persuade him some
more, but Chang YuChun would not waver.
Zhang SanFeng finally gave up, shook his head, and sighed. Then he said, “This girl...”
Chang YuChun said, “Don’t worry. This girl’s father died because of me. I’m definitely
going to take care of her.” Zhang SanFeng said, “Alright. But you cannot let her enter
your cult.” Chang YuChun said, “I really don’t know what we do that make us so despi-
cable in your mind. But if you insist, I’ll obey your wish.”

Zhang SanFeng held Zhang WuJi in his arms, and said, “Then let us part now.” He really
doesn’t want any more to do with the Devil Cult, and therefore left out the words ‘See
you later’.
Zhou ZhiRuo said to Zhang WuJi, “Little friend. You need to eat everyday, so the old
priest won’t worry about you.” Zhang WuJi’s tears came out, and said, “Thank you for
your words. It’s just that... I’ll only be able to eat for just a while longer.” Zhang
SanFeng cleaned out Zhang WuJi’s tears with his sleeve. Zhou ZhiRuo asked in shock,
“What? You... You...” Zhang SanFeng said, “Little girl, you have a kind heart. I hope
you’ll later go on the route of righteousness, and not of evil.”
Zhou ZhiRuo said, “Ok. But this little friend, why does he say that he can only eat for
just a while longer?” Zhang SanFeng could not respond.

Chang YuChun said, “Venerable Zhang, considering your martial arts abilities, surely
you can cure this little friend’s poison, right?” Zhang SanFeng said, “Of course I can.”
But he then shook his left hand behind Zhang WuJi, pointing out that Zhang WuJi is be-
yond help, but doesn’t want him to know it.
Upon seeing Zhang SanFeng shaking his hand, Chang YuChun gasped. He said, “Due to
the severity of my injuries, I was just about to go see a very distinguished doctor. How
about I take this little friend with me?” Zhang SanFeng shook his head, said, “His cold
poison has already entered the vital organs. It’s not something normal medicine can
cure. We only... only hope to slowly disperse the poison.” Chang YuChun said, “But the
doctor I’m talking about has the ability to bring back the dead.”
Zhang SanFeng suddenly remembered a person, and asked, “Are you talking about the
‘Divine Doctor of the Butterfly Valley’?”
Chang YuChun said, “That’s right. So you know about Elder Hu too?”
Zhang SanFeng thought, “From my knowledge, this ‘Divine Doctor of the Butterfly
Valley’, Hu QingNuo, does indeed have unparalleled medical skills. But he is member of
the Devil Cult. Besides, he has a very strange temper. He’ll do his best to cure any Devil
Cult followers, and not ask for a single penny. Yet he will not treat anyone else, no mat-
ter how much money is offered. Therefore, he has another nickname, ‘Rather See Death
Than Help’. If so, it’s really better for WuJi to die than to enter the Devil Cult.”

Seeing the grave expression on Zhang SanFeng’s face, Chang YuChun understood what
he’s thinking, and said, “Venerable Zhang, I know Elder Hu never treats outsiders. But
since you saved my life, I’ll do anything I can to make Elder Hu break the rule this one
time.” Zhang SanFeng said, “I know just how amazing this Doctor Hu’s skills are. But
unfortunately, this cold poison on WuJi’s body is very unique...” Chang YuChun said,
“But you can’t cure him. The worst that can happen is that Elder Hu can’t cure him ei-
ther. If he’s going to die regardless, what’s the big deal?” Chang YuChun is a straightfor-
ward person, and therefore said what he thought.
Zhang SanFeng pondered a bit, “He’s right. Look like WuJi only has about another
month to live. What is there to be afraid of?” Zhang SanFeng has always been a very
sincere person, and normally never thinks about possible hidden motives. But Zhang
WuJi is his disciple’s only child. How could he give WuJi to a member of the Devil Cult?
At this moment, he really doesn’t know what to do.

Chang YuChun said, “I know Venerable Zhang doesn’t want to go see Elder Hu. After all,
how could a head of a righteous sect seek help from us evil cults? Besides, with Elder
Hu’s strange temper, he’d probably offend you. I guess the only is way is for me to take
Brother Zhang to Elder Hu. Then I’ll come to Wu Dang Mountain to be your hostage.
Should anything happen to Brother Zhang, you can go ahead and kill me.”
Zhang SanFeng chuckled, thought, “Should anything really happen to WuJi, how would
killing you help? Besides, how can I be sure you’ll definitely come to Wu Dang?” But
considering WuJi’s condition, there really isn’t any other possible cure. So Zhang
SanFeng said, “If so, then please take care of WuJi. But I must make two things clear.
Mr. Hu cannot force WuJi into your cult. And Wu Dang is not going to accept your grati-
tude on this matter.” He knew that the Devil Cult is very devious and strange in its
ways. Being associated with them could only lead to big problems. After all, isn’t Zhang
CuiShan’s death a perfect example?
Chang YuChun said, “Venerable Zhang is really belittling my cult. But if you say so, I’ll
obey.” Zhang SanFeng said, “Take good care of WuJi. Should he ever recover, take him
back to Wu Dang. But there’s no need to come to Wu Dang as a hostage.” Chang YuChun
said, “I’ll do all I can to follow your wishes.”
Zhang SanFeng said, “As for this little girl, I’ll take her back to Wu Dang Mountain.”

Chang YuChun then went to a large tree by the shore, and dug a hole with his saber.
Then he took off all of Little Master Zhou’s clothes, before burying him in the ground,
and paid his respects. Burying members naked is one of Ming Cult’s rules. Everyone en-
ters the world naked, and should therefore leave the world the same way. Since Zhang
SanFeng does not know this rule, he found the burial procedure quite repulsive and
mysterious.
The next morning, Zhang SanFeng took Zhou ZhiRuo in his hands, and parted with
Chang YuChun and Zhang WuJi. After the death of his parents, Zhang SanFeng was like
a grandfather to Zhang WuJi. So Zhang WuJi couldn’t help but burst into tears as they
parted. Zhang SanFeng said, “WuJi, when you’re healthy again, your Big Brother Chang
will take you back to Wu Dang Mountain. Be a good boy. We’ll only be apart for a few
months. Don’t be so sad.” Despite his words, Zhang WuJi’s tears did not stop.
Zhou ZhiRuo returned to the boat, took out a handkerchief from her sleeve, and began
to wipe away his tears. She then smiled at him, put the handkerchief into his pocket, be-
fore returning to shore.

Zhang Wuji followed his grand-teacher with his eyes as the old man walked westwards
with Zhou Zhiruo. As the same time, the little girl kept turning back and waving until
both of them disappeared behind a row of poplar and willow trees. Suddenly, Zhang
Wuji felt so lonely that he started to cry again.
